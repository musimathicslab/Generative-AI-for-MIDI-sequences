## 📖 Description

**Generative AI for MIDI Sequences** is a thesis project focused on extending the capabilities of generative music models for stylistically complex genres — specifically **Metal music** — and integrating real-time procedural generation into a Unity-based interactive environment.

Despite significant advancements in AI-based music generation, general-purpose pre-trained models often struggle when applied to highly structured and stylistically demanding genres.

Preliminary experiments using pre-trained MusicVAE models produced convincing results in Classical and Jazz domains. However, when applied to Metal, significant limitations emerged:
* **Lack of rhythmic consistency**
* **Weak harmonic coherence**
* **Absence of genre-specific features** (such as complex drum patterns and fast tempo structures)

These issues were directly linked to the limited representation of Metal music within the original training datasets.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objective of this thesis was to develop a system capable of generating **dynamic and stylistically coherent Metal music in real time**, integrated within a Unity game environment.

**Key goals achieved:**
* ✅ Creation of a **specialized Metal MIDI dataset**
* ✅ Fine-tuning MusicVAE models for genre-specific generation
* ✅ Real-time integration through **OSC communication**
* ✅ Development of a responsive procedural music system for interactive environments

---

## 🧠 Research Contribution

This project demonstrates how **targeted fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets significantly extends the expressive capabilities of generative models**, allowing them to operate effectively in stylistically complex domains. 

The final result is a **functional prototype** in which procedural generation dynamically responds to user interaction inside a game environment.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Environment Setup
1. Install [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/).
2. Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies (`tensorflow`, `magenta`, etc.).

> ⚠️ **Note:** Magenta and TensorFlow require careful dependency management. **Python 3.10** is strictly required for compatibility.

### 2️⃣ Dataset Preparation
1. Download your Metal MIDI files.
2. Place them inside your designated dataset directory.
3. To separate instrumental tracks (Guitar, Bass, Drums), run:
   👉 [`Scripts/splitter.py`](./Scripts/splitter.py)

### 3️⃣ TFRecord Conversion
After splitting the tracks, convert each instrument dataset into the TFRecord format required by MusicVAE:
* 🎸 **Guitar:** [`Scripts/convert_guitar_to_tf.py`](./Scripts/convert_guitar_to_tf.py)
* 🎸 **Bass:** [`Scripts/convert_bass_to_tf.py`](./Scripts/convert_bass_to_tf.py)
* 🥁 **Drums:** [`Scripts/convert_drums_to_tf.py`](./Scripts/convert_drums_to_tf.py)

### 4️⃣ Model Fine-Tuning
The following pre-trained MusicVAE models were selected for fine-tuning based on the instrument:

| Instrument | Base Model | Training Script |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🎸 **Guitar** | `cat-mel_2bar_big` | [`Scripts/train_guitar.py`](./Scripts/train_guitar.py) |
| 🎸 **Bass** | `cat-mel_2bar_med_chords` | [`Scripts/train_bass.py`](./Scripts/train_bass.py) |
| 🥁 **Drums** | `cat-drums_2bar_small` | [`Scripts/train_drums.py`](./Scripts/train_drums.py) |

**Configuration:** Training parameters (`num_steps`, `batch_size`, `checkpoint_interval`) can be configured directly inside each script.

---

## 🎹 MIDI Generation

After training your models, you can generate new, original MIDI sequences using:

👉 [`Scripts/generate_MIDI.py`](./Scripts/generate_MIDI.py)

**Customization:** The generation process is highly flexible. By modifying the parameters inside the script, you can vary the generated music at will—editing musical progressions, structural logic, and other core data to perfectly shape the final output to your liking.

---

## 🎼 Musical Validation

Generated MIDI files were imported into **MuseScore Studio** for rigorous evaluation:
* 🎼 **Score visualization**
* 🏗️ **Structural validation**
* 🎧 **Auditory evaluation**

---

## 🎮 Unity Integration

Once trained, the system is adapted for real-time use inside Unity using the **OSC (Open Sound Control)** protocol to trigger adaptive audio dynamically.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install OSCJack:** Download and import the [**OSCJack package**](https://github.com/keijiro/OscJack) into your Unity project, following the installation instructions on its GitHub page.
2. **Create the Manager:** In your Unity scene hierarchy, create an empty GameObject and name it `OSCManager`.
3. **Create the Players:** Inside `OSCManager`, create 5 separate child GameObjects: `GuitarPlayer`, `BassPlayer`, `KickPlayer`, `SnarePlayer`, and `HiHatPlayer`.
4. **Assign Audio Samples:** Add an `AudioSource` component to each of those 5 Player GameObjects. Assign a short, representative audio sample (downloaded from the internet) to the `AudioClip` property of each one.
5. **Attach the Script:** Add the receiver script to your `OSCManager` GameObject:
   👉 [`Scripts/MetalReceiver.cs`](./Scripts/MetalReceiver.cs)
6. **Link Components:** Select the `OSCManager`. In the Unity Inspector, drag and drop the respective Player GameObjects into the newly exposed fields created by the script.

This architecture allows procedural music to respond directly and instantly to gameplay events, changing the audio behavior fluidly according to the AI-generated musical structures.

## 📌 Current Status

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is currently a **research prototype** and has not yet been released as a production-ready system.

It serves as a comprehensive proof-of-concept demonstrating:
* Genre-specialized generative AI
* Real-time procedural music systems
* Interactive AI-driven audio design

## 🔬 Future Work

* 📈 **Expansion** of the Metal dataset for broader stylistic coverage.
* 🔗 **Multi-instrument conditioning** for tighter band cohesion.
* 🎭 **Emotional modulation models** to drive music based on game tension.
* 🏥 **Validation in therapeutic environments** (e.g., active music therapy).
